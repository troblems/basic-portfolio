<h1>Amanda Wittenstein</h1>
<p>I grew up in California, and moved to Austin after finding it in both comfortable culture and climate. I've got an incredibly supportive family who has allowed me to follow to my passion of coding, which I found a bit later in life than I would have prefered. I have more pets than I really like to mention. I'm a typical cartoon loving nerd, ranging from tradition Disney, to anime, to more modern Steven Univer and My Little Pony. </p>
